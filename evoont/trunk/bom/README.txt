The file bom-4.1.owl was downloaded on 2009/08/28 from
http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/ddis/evoont/2008/11/bom/bom.owl to keep a
reference version of the original.

The file bom.owl was similar to bom-4.1.owl, as of rev. 209.
As of today, rev. 217 of bom.owl should be usable with Protege 4.0.

There have been only syntactic changes, and no semantic modification
(hence keeping the same URI for the ontology identification :
http://www.ifi.uzh.ch/ddis/evoont/2008/11/bom#)

I hope this improves the situation.
