Jesse pointed out module names are wrong. Please fix the proposal and
let us know. My requirements:

01 module names are wrong
02 what type each module is going to be - autoload, regular or eager
03 autoload modules should not have any UI or anything in layer (not
even settings) is that satisfied
04 what is the "indentation framework"?
05 what will be the public packages or each module
06 are you sure you want org.netbeans.api package? Are you ready for
the work? What will be the initial content?
07 why the Settings class cannot be moved to different package?
08 would not is be possible to have just one settings module that
would somehow read hints provided by various kits? This is real bloat
of *settings*.jars.

Btw. I think that if the basic editor module is going to be autoload,
it makes sence to register the plain kit in different module.""";

         :content """I have updated the editor module split document
http://editor.netbeans.org/doc/Proposals/ModuleSplit/DesignView.html
as necessary but I leave the issue closed as the review of the editor
module split will be done as part of the Editor APIs Documentation
review (issue #52275).

Reply to questions:
 - editor/plain will be used (not text/plain)
 - as Yarda pointed out we will make the infrastructure modules
autoloads so I think extract plain editor should be appropriate.
 - I have fixed the module names.

 ad 01) done.

 ad 02) three autoloads (highlighted in "Notes" section in the doc)

 ad 03) will be satisfied

 ad 04) will be done in a different way. We will move the java
indentation engine physically into javacore module. Java-specific
editor module will plug its indentation implementation into it using a
friend SPI.

 ad 05) I have marked currently needed public packages as bold in the
document. They should continue to be public after the split (in the
respective modules) as they are used (e.g. by JSP module) but of
course in the future I would like to revise the dependencies.
 I have not decided PP for the bookmarks submodule yet but there will
likely be one PP for a friend API (SPI will likely not be necessary).
As the bookmarks submodule will in fact contain a new functionality it
will be created after the physical split of the current editor is
finished.

 ad 06) I have removed mentioning of the org.netbeans.api (and .spi)
in the modules' packages as it adds no value (was there historically).
I can't tell now whether we will request the official stability for
anything in the editor's core infrastructure. In the future I would
like to have just the core functionality in the main editor's module
(document, views and actions infrastructures) and extract other things
(like code completion, abbrevs, macros etc.) into submodules. But this
is still a preliminary view.

 ad 07) I was not meant to be moved into different package but into
different module which IIRC cannot be done due to the NB module
classloaders preventing to have classes from a single packages in two
different modules unless you have a special exception ;)
 Actually I've changed the document and I would prefer to not create
the settings submodules immediately but instead wait for a proper
editor settings API/SPI to be developed first.

 ad 08) IMHO not as the target kits will be in the target
language-specific editor modules containing the kits registration etc.
and in fact we are doing the settings separation to not require our
language-specific editor modules. BTW I have changed the policy
regarding the "lib" modules to not produce them for small modules such
as settings (described in the doc).""";

the org.netbeans.modules.editor.options was splitted in non-backward

HTMLOptions and PlainOptions) plus the corresponding bean info classes
