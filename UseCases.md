## Introduction ##

We need to develop a number of use cases for the ontology to help make architectural decisions.


## Details ##

The aim of this is to enable a number of things:
  * SPARQL end points on a bug database that can be queried (see [SPARQLexamples](SPARQLexamples.md) )
  * Bugs in one open source project that refer to bugs in other open source projects, and that specify their dependency on these
  * A format for bug databases to exchange their bug data ( see [N3examples](N3examples.md) )
  * Relating bugs to software artifacts so that these issues can be tracked
  * others?
