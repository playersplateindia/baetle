However, most issue trackers uses Task as a subClass of an issue, as a task that needs to be executed. This differs from other issues such as Bug and Enhancement. A Bug needs to be resolved, but the actual Task that needs to be executed could perhaps just be to mark it as a duplicate. An Enhancement is something that could be implemented or perhaps rejected. Hence we need to express this use of Task in the issue trackers in Baetle. I'm leaning towards keeping this as a special subClassOf Issue. We should keep Issue as subClassOf wf:Task though as the wf:state property is very useful."@en;

# Use multiple inheritance to specify status + resolution of an issue e.g. Resolved, Later or Closed, Fixed
