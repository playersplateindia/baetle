There are a number of Bug Databases that may be interested in this ontology. It would be useful to develop a D2RQ mapping for each of these databases. Here is a partial list:

  * [Bugzilla](http://www.bugzilla.org/): one of the most widely used open source bug tracking systems: bblfish contacted them
  * [JIRA](http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/): A closed source bug tracking system which I have seen used on a number of open source software projects, such as [Roller](http://rollerweblogger.org). Contacted by bblfish.
  * [Mantis Bug Tracker](http://www.mantisbt.org/): open source (GPL) PHP-based system, with a fairly large feature list
  * [BugZero](http://www.websina.com/bugzero/)
  * [Issue View](http://www.issueview.com/default.asp?source=Google)
  * [Problem Tracker](http://www.problemtracker.com/)
  * [Rally Software Development](http://www.rallydev.com/?ppc=google&kw=bug_tracking)
  * [Fog Bugz](http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/)
  * [Intland Software](http://www.intland.com/)


Oops a full list is [available on Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue_tracking_systems)
