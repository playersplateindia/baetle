#summary Tim Berners Lee's Workflow Ontology


Tim Berners Lee wrote a [http://www.w3.org/2005/01/wf/ Workflow ontology], that could be useful for us. Bugs are tasks that are in certain states. Fixing bugs is transition their state to a terminal state. In order to get a quick overview of it I drew up a UML diagram:

Depends on a license related "doc" ontology http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/doc also created by Tim Berners Lee: Workflow ontology uses _doc:Work_

The "doc" depends on a "contact" ontology http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/pim/contact still by TBL: "doc" ontology depends on contact:SocialEntity (which subsumes contact:Person).

Todo: 
  * explain N3 Work Flow rules
  * draw diagrams of the other two ontologies?
  * how does this compare to the [http://www.loa-cnr.it/ontologies/Plans.owl Plans ontology] (the rdf for that is broken btw)

== Relation to Plans.owl ==

  * [http://metacognition.info/ontologies/pomr-full.html#state state]
  * [http://metacognition.info/ontologies/pomr-full.html#action action]
  * [http://metacognition.info/ontologies/pomr-full.html#task task]
