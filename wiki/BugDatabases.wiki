#summary Bug Databases

There are a number of Bug Databases that may be interested in this ontology. It would be useful to develop a D2RQ mapping for each of these databases. Here is a partial list:

 * [http://www.bugzilla.org/ Bugzilla]: one of the most widely used open source bug tracking systems
 * [http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/ JIRA]: A closed source bug tracking system which I have seen used on a number of open source software projects, such as [http://rollerweblogger.org Roller]
 * [http://www.mantisbt.org/ Mantis Bug Tracker]: open source (GPL) PHP-based system, with a fairly large feature list
