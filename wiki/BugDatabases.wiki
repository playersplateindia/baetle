#summary Bug Databases

There are a number of Bug Databases that may be interested in this ontology. It would be useful to develop a D2RQ mapping for each of these databases. Here is a partial list:

 * [http://www.bugzilla.org/ Bugzilla]: one of the most widely used open source bug tracking systems: bblfish contacted them
 * [http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/ JIRA]: A closed source bug tracking system which I have seen used on a number of open source software projects, such as [http://rollerweblogger.org Roller]. Contacted by bblfish.
 * [http://www.mantisbt.org/ Mantis Bug Tracker]: open source (GPL) PHP-based system, with a fairly large feature list
 * [http://www.websina.com/bugzero/ BugZero]
 * [http://www.issueview.com/default.asp?source=Google Issue View]
 * [http://www.problemtracker.com/ Problem Tracker]
 * [http://www.rallydev.com/?ppc=google&kw=bug_tracking Rally Software Development]
 * [http://www.fogcreek.com/FogBugz/ Fog Bugz]
 * [http://www.intland.com/ Intland Software]
