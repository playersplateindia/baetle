#summary SPARQL examples for querying a database

= Introduction =

Using the latest ontology here are some examples of SPARQL queries

= Examples =

=== bugs that depend on a bug ===

Return all bugs that depend on the Netbeans bug 59890

{{{
PREFIX beatle: <http://xmlns.com/baetle/0.1/ns#> 
SELECT ?bug
WHERE {
    ?bug baetle:depends_on <http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=59890#it> .

}
}}}

=== bugs that are related to some source code ===

Return all bugs that are about some source code and that are open (here we may not wish to identify the source code by version, but rather all versions of it).

{{{
PREFIX baetle: <http://xmlns.com/baetle/0.1/ns#> 
SELECT ?bug
WHERE {
    ?bug beatle:about [ :id <http://www.netbeans.org/source/browse/beans/src/org/netbeans/modules/beans/BeanPatternGenerator.java>
                ];
         baetle:status :open .

}
}}}

=== Bugs that block a bug of priority P1 ===
 
{{{
SELECT * 
WHERE {
  ?bug baetle:blocks [
             baetle:priority <http://wiki.netbeans.org/baetle/priorities#P1>
             ] .
   OPTIONAL { ?bug baetle:assigned_to ?dev . }
}
}}}

In English: find me all bugs that are blocking bugs of priority P1, and give me the assigned developer if there is one.
