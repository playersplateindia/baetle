#summary Ontologies to look at


Listed here are some ontologies that we should look at and work with

  * [http://xmlns.com/foaf/0.1/ FOAF]: The Friend of a Friend Ontology is very important to identify people and relations between them
  * [http://usefulinc.com/ns/doap DOAP]: To describe bugs the Description of a Project ontology is clearly very handy. Local UML diagram at: [DoapOntology]
  * [http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/ SKOS]: there are many ways of organising projects and classifying bugs. The SKOS ontology gives a very lightweigh way of creating metadata for wiki powered ontologies that are project specific, without requiring a full blown ontology such as this one to be designed.
  * WorkFlowOntology: Tim Berners Lee wrote out a WorkFlowOntology. Bugs affect workflows. They are in certain states and can have state transitions.

Suggested one we can work with or should be compatible with
  * [http://dannyayers.com:88/xmlns/project/ Project Vocabulary] Danny Ayers started a Project Vocabulary. Software projects are projects, so this looks useful.
  * [http://bblfish.net/work/atom/2006-06-06 AtomOwl] When looking at bug reports such as [http://www.netbeans.org/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=21365 Netbeans bug id 21365] the bug looks very much like a feed, with the comments looking very much like entries. It also seems obvious that one could use the [http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/ Atom Publication Protocol] to publish replies to a bug or to create new issues.
  * [http://www.holygoat.co.uk/projects/tags/ Tag Ontology] every bug system allows one to assign keywords to bugs. Keywords are similar to tags which are similar to Atom Categories as argued in  [http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/folksonomies_ontologies_atom_and_the Folksonomies, Ontologies and Atom]
  * [http://www.metalinker.org/ MetaLink ] has an xml format for helping mirroring of downloads and helping clients selecting the best mirror. [http://chatlogs.planetrdf.com/swig/2007-03-06.html#T17-05-23 twanj is working on an Ontology] for it.
  * [http://sw.nokia.com/WebArch-1/ Web Archictecture] There may be more standard one coming about
  * [http://www.w3.org/TR/test-metadata/ Test Metadata] a rdf vocabulary for describing tests
  * [http://www.w3.org/TR/EARL10/ EARL] Evaluation and Report Language, ontology to test resources (could tie test classes to source code?)
