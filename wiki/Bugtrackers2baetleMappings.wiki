= Introduction =

This page shows intended *mappings from different bugtrackers to baetle*. 

Feel free to update this page!!

The goals of this page are to:
  # Be a guideline for how one should map bugtracker properties to baetle
  # Help to verify that baetle is "complete"



= Details =

The tables below shows how different concepts and properties of different bugtrackers should be mapped to baetle. _Concepts and properties within parentheses needs some clarification_ - see the mailing list for possible details.

== baetle:Issue ==
baetle:Issue inherits from wf:Task. It has Defect and Enhancement as subclasses. There's a discussion on the mailing list on where to map (Jira and Tracs) Task. Other custom Issue types that are used are also of interest to discuss.

|| *Baetle* || *Trac* || *Jira* || _please add other bugtrackers_ ||
|| Task     || Task   || Task   || ||
|| Issue    || (Custom) || (Custom) || ||
|| Defect   || Defect || Bug || ||
|| Enhancement || Enhancement || New feature, Improvement || ||

== baetle:priority ==

baetle:Priority has the subclasses Critical, Major, Blocker, Trivial and Minor

|| *Baetle* || *Trac* || *Jira* || _please add other bugtrackers_ ||
|| Priority || (Custom) || || ||
|| Critical || critical || Critical || ||
|| Major || major || Major || ||
|| Trivial || trivial || Trivial || ||
|| Blocker || blocker || Blocker || ||
|| Minor || minor || Minor || ||

== wf:state ==

Is there too much complexity here? Some states should probably be merged? See the mailing list..

Should status be removed (left to wf:state) ? See the mailing list..

== Unmapped bugtracker properties == 

|| Trac || Jira || _please add other bugtrackers_ ||
|| Ticket # || Issue key || ||

|| - || Fix version's || ||

We should probably don't care about Trac's severity or Jira's custom fields. 


== TODO ==
  * Add other bugtrackers
  * Someone should verify this =)
