#summary Overview of Baetle
= Introduction =

Baetle stands for Bug And Enhancement Tracking LanguagE. It is an ontology that describes what bug repositories such as Bugzilla, Jira and others do.

The aim of this is to enable a number of things:
  * SPARQL end points on a bug database that can be queried
  * Bugs in one open source project that refer to bugs in other open source projects, and that specify their dependency on these
  * A format for bug databases to exchange their bug data
  * Relating bugs to software artifacts so that these issues can be tracked
  * others?

= History =

This idea has been developing for some time.  Henry Story (bblfish) first outlined the advantages such an ontology can have in [http://onesearch.sun.com/search/blog/index.jsp?col=blog&charset=utf-8&weblog=bblfish&qt=video semantic web video]. The first details of this ontology were written out in the blog entry [http://blogs.sun.com/bblfish/entry/baetle_bug_and_enhancement_tracking Baetle: Bug And Enhancement Tracking LanguagE]
