These could be added to the issues database, but that seems a little heavy for something still so much in flux.

### Relation to Atom (rfc4287) ###

> Atom is defined by [RFC 4287](http://www.atompub.org/).
> Atom Protocol is  [curently being finalised](http://bitworking.org/projects/atom/).
> Atom has a corresponding ontology [Atom Owl Ontology](http://bblfish.net/work/atom/2006-06-06/) which we call awol.

> What is the relation between an :Issue and an awol:Entry, awol:Feed or awol:Collection ? There seems to be something very closely related. Here is one idea.

> Somewhere we can very well imagine having an atom Collection, and POSTing Issues to that Collection. Would this make a POSTing be a [wf:Creation](WorkFlowOntology.md) of an Issue?

> An issue has a number of comments associated with it. Does this make an Issue also be a app:Collection? Does POSTing to that collection then create new states? Usually comments, but we can imagine some other states such as verification of an issue, classification, etc..

> More thoughts?
